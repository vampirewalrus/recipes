# Recipes from the Vampire Walrus

This site is a simple collection of my recipes.  

I'm generally trying to meet three criteria for inclusion: plant-based, low(ish) carb (not remotely keto, but just generally trying to counteract the tendency of vegetarian diets to drift towards pastas, breads, and rice), and sustainable (at least in the sense of not over-relying on tropical crops like coconut and cashews).
