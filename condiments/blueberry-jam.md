## Blueberry-maple jam

This is a very simple low-sugar jam (well, technically compote), with only three essential ingredients: blueberries (frozen is fine!), maple syrup, and apple cider vinegar.  You can add a pinch of xanthan gum to thicken it, as well, and I also add some other aromatic ingredients (spices, vanilla, and lemon oil).

This recipe works with almost any frozen fruit, but the thickness will depend on the amount of natural pectin in the fruit, so you may need to adjust the xanthan gum to accommodate.  The absolute best so far have been wild blueberries from Atlantic Canada, Quebec, or Maine; most of the wild blueberry crop is frozen so check the freezer section.  This is also great as a hot pepper jam!  Just add fresh hot peppers to your level of tolerance.

Makes: about 1 cup of jam.

### Ingredients

| Quantity | ingredient | substitutions |
|:---:| --- | --- |
| 2 cups | blueberries | *or any frozen fruit* |
| 1/4 cup | apple cider vinegar | *go ahead and sub wine vinegar, balsamic, etc.* |
| 3 tbsp | maple syrup | *you can sub any kind of sugar here* |
| 1 tsp | vanilla extract | *optional* |
| 1/4 tsp | cinnamon and/or mixed spices | *optional; I use ~1/8 tsp cinnamon, ~1/16 tsp cloves, ~1/16 tsp ginger, and one grate of fresh nutmeg* |
| 1 drop | lemon essential oil | *optional; be very careful with this, it's potent* |
| 1/8 tsp | xanthan gum | *optional* |
| 1/8 tsp | salt | *optional* |


### Instructions

- In a small saucepan, combine the blueberries, vinegar, maple syrup, and spices.
- Cook over low heat, stirring occasionally, until the blueberries give up their juice
- Sprinkle the xanthan gum over the top, a little bit at a time, to prevent clumping.
- Continue to cook, stirring frequently, until the compote reduces to a jam-like consistency.  It's done when you can "draw a line" on the bottom of the saucepan with a spatula, and the compote takes a moment to fill it back in.
- Pour into a sterilized jar, keep refrigerated, and consume within 7-10 days.
