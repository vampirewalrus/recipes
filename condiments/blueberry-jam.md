## Blueberry-maple jam

This is a very simple low-sugar jam (well, technically compote), with only three essential ingredients: blueberries (frozen is fine!), maple syrup, and apple cider vinegar.  You can add a pinch of xanthan gum to thicken it, as well, and I also add some other aromatic ingredients (spices, vanilla, and lemon oil).

This recipe works with almost any frozen fruit: blueberry, mango, peach, you name it!  (Although my attempts at strawberry have turned out a bit fruit-rollup-y.)  The best so far have been wild blueberries from Atlantic Canada, Quebec, or Maine; most of the wild blueberry crop is frozen so check the freezer section.

This is also great as a hot pepper jam!  Just add fresh hot peppers to your level of tolerance, or a bit of hot sauce.  Note that the heat of fresh peppers will start to mellow after a few days.

Note: Like most other low-sugar jams, this is *not* a recipe designed for canning and long-term storage.  You should aim to consume this within a week or so, it won't keep forever.

Makes: about 1 cup of jam.

### Ingredients

| Quantity | ingredient | substitutions |
|:---:| --- | --- |
| 2 cups | blueberries | *or any frozen fruit* |
| 1/4 cup | apple cider vinegar | *go ahead and sub wine vinegar, balsamic, etc.* |
| 3 tbsp | maple syrup | *you can sub any kind of sugar here* |
| 1 tsp | vanilla extract | *optional* |
| 1/4 tsp | cinnamon and/or mixed spices | *optional; I use ~1/8 tsp cinnamon, ~1/16 tsp cloves, ~1/16 tsp ginger, and one grate of fresh nutmeg* |
| 1 drop | lemon essential oil | *optional; be very careful with this, it's potent* |
| 1/8 tsp | xanthan gum | *optional* |


### Instructions

- In a small saucepan, combine the blueberries, vinegar, maple syrup, and spices.
- Cook over low heat, stirring occasionally, until the blueberries give up their juice
- Sprinkle the xanthan gum over the top, a little bit at a time, to prevent clumping.
- Continue to cook, stirring frequently, until the compote reduces to a jam-like consistency.  It's done when you can "draw a line" on the bottom of the saucepan with a spatula, and the compote takes a moment to fill it back in.
- Pour into a sterilized jar, and consume within 7-10 days.
